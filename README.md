# Mbed-ArduinoNano33BLE
Mbed-OS Features on Arduino Nano33 BLE to use with phyphox

What it does:
The file writes data read from Analog Pin 1 to a characteristic and these values are then sent to phyphox app.

The measured data (I used a simple variable voltage divider aka potentiometer) are then visualized in the app phyphox which you can download from www.phyphox.org. 

You do not need any further knowledge in phyphox it's simply used as a plotter for the data (although it can do a lot more). 
So if you ever wanted to get your data to a nice app that visualizes the data download phyphox and get a NanoBle 33 and use this file.
