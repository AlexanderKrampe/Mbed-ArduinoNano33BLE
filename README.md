# Mbed-ArduinoNano33BLE
Mbed-OS Features on Arduino Nano33 BLE to use with phyphox

What it does:
The file sends data read from Analog Pin 1 to a charavtetristic. 

The measured data (I used a simple variable voltage divider aka potentiometer) are then visualized in the app phyphox which you can download from www.phyphox.org. 

You do not need any further knowledge in phyphox it's simply used as a plotter for the data (although it can do a lot more).
