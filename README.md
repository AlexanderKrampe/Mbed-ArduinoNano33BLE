# Mbed-ArduinoNano33BLE
Mbed-OS Features on Arduino Nano33 BLE to use with phyphox


The file sets up a BLE server and advertises its service. The purpose of the file is to send an experiment 
made for phyphox (www.phyphox.org) from the Arduino Nano33 BLE to the phyphox app. 

Thread and eventQueue are used from mbed library.

You can also use this file as a template to set up a BLE Server with data transfer without phyphox.
